Author's note: Although these are valid Sokoban levels, each with at                        least one valid solution, the purpose of these levels is to illustrate certain facts about Sokoban, or certain arrangements of initial state in Sokoban levels, or situations that sometimes arise in the course of trying to solve a Sokoban level.
